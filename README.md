# wupy
cupy but on wgpu

This is an experiment to see if we can mimic Cupy with wgpu. This could provide
insight into the role that webgpu can play in WGPU compute, within the scientific Python ecosystem. One major benefit would be that it'd work on any GPU, including
MacOS and Intel Integrated Graphics.
